# Before Start Coding

## What is Croct?

> Understand what **Croct** brings to the table

Croct is a SaaS platform that uses AI to provide:

* Different layers of real-time personalization to tailor the user’s experience online
* An easy way to do AB Testing to validate hypothesis
* Dashboards to validate strategies and give insights

With all these functions, marketing, product and engineering teams can boost conversion, improve user experience and increase engagement without having to undergo an extensive, time consuming and costly development.

## Implementation Process

**Gathering Data**

The first step is to gather the information that will fuel the personalization engine. Don’t worry! All data is anonymized and in accordance with data privacy laws :smiley:. 

**Defining Strategy and Goals**

The second step is defining the audience and experiments, what will be personalized, and the KPIs to help measure the outcome.

**Implementing**

The last step is actually implementing the personalization and tracking the results.
